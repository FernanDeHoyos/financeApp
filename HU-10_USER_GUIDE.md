# HU-10: Gráfico de Gastos — User Guide

## Feature: Ver Gráficos de Gastos por Categoría

### Overview
Now you can visualize your spending patterns in multiple ways on your Dashboard. Three different views help you understand where your money is going.

## The Three Charts

### 1. Pie Chart - "Gastos por Categoría"
**Purpose:** See which categories you spend the most on at a glance

**What you see:**
- A colorful donut chart with your expense categories
- Each slice represents a category
- Legend shows exact amounts and percentages
- Insight panel highlighting your highest spending category

**Example:**
If you spent:
- $500 on Food (40%)
- $300 on Transport (24%)
- $250 on Entertainment (20%)
- $200 on Utilities (16%)

You'll see these as proportional slices with a note: "Tu categoría con mayor gasto es Food con $500.00"

**How to use it:**
- Look at the pie chart to identify your biggest spending area
- Check the legend for exact amounts
- Use the insight to adjust your budget if needed

### 2. Bar Chart - "Gastos Últimos 6 Meses"
**Purpose:** Track spending trends over time

**What you see:**
- 6 bars representing the last 6 months
- Each bar shows total spending for that month
- Animated transitions for smooth visualization
- Summary showing your highest spending month

**Example:**
```
Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun
500  520  450  600  550  480
            ↑ Highest month
```

**How to use it:**
- Spot months where you spent more
- Identify if spending is trending up or down
- See if certain months are consistently higher

### 3. Statistics Panel - "4 Key Metrics"
**Purpose:** Quick numbers to understand your spending

**Four metrics shown:**

1. **Gasto Promedio** (Average Expense)
   - Total spending ÷ Number of transactions
   - Tells you typical transaction size
   
2. **Mayor Gasto** (Highest Single Expense)
   - Your largest transaction amount
   - Shows biggest purchase

3. **Número de Gastos** (Total Transactions)
   - How many expense records you have
   - Transaction frequency indicator

4. **Más Frecuente** (Most Frequent Category)
   - Category with most transactions (not highest amount)
   - Shows habit patterns

**Example:**
```
Gasto Promedio    Mayor Gasto
$45.50           $150.00

Número de Gastos  Más Frecuente
34 gastos        Food
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my category split differently in the pie chart?**
A: If you created custom categories in HU-09, they'll show here. Custom categories appear alongside predefined ones.

**Q: Why do statistics show "Más Frecuente" differently than highest spending?**
A: Frequency (count) is different from amount. You might have 10 small food purchases ($20 each) but 1 transport purchase ($300). Food is most frequent, transport costs more.

**Q: Can I change the time period shown?**
A: Currently showing last 6 months. Future versions will allow custom date ranges.

**Q: How are the colors chosen for categories?**
A: Colors are assigned in order you create categories. Each gets a unique color for easy identification.

**Q: Do charts update automatically?**
A: Yes! Charts update instantly when you add, edit, or delete transactions.
